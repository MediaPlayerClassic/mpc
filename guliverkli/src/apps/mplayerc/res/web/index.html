			Sorry, this is just a little demo page for now, I'm still awaiting ideas what 
			to put here ... and mostly why (hehe) Anyway, I'm sure there will be some use 
			of this web server in the future. You users can always come up with something.

			And if you are already here, why don't you try sending a few commands to MPC, 
			just to see if it works :)
