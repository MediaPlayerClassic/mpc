Because Visual Studio becomes a turtle when there are many little projects, I didn't set up dependencies between them and didn't put them all into one workspace per application. These are more or less the base of everything, build them in this order first:
1. deccs
2. dsutil
3. ui/*
4. subpic
5. subtitles
6. filters (run \lib\filters.bat to merge them)

Required SDKs:
- DirectX 9 SDK (you may need to add "Debug Unicode" and "Release Unicode" configs to the project file of the directshow baseclasses)
- Platform SDK
- Windows Media Format SDK 9

It is recommended that you add DX9's include and lib paths to Visual Studio before the others:
C:\DXSDK\Samples\C++\DirectShow\BaseClasses
C:\DXSDK\Include
...

C:\DXSDK\lib
...

Other external header files are included directly, modify the path in the sources if your installation differs. (but don't COMMIT it to the CVS!)

Debug builds use dynamic, Release builds use static linking to standard C/C++ and MFC libs.

Subresync and Submux aren't working yet, they are just there because I might convert them to fit the new libs someday.
